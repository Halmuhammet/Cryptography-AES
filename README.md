## 🧠 Summary: You can use AES encription algorithm using crypto library
         First, generate a AES secret key
         Second, pass the secret key to AES cipher to with encrypt mode
         Finally, pass the byte version of plaintext to the cipher (AES) to encrypt
## Note: If you want to reverse the process and decrypt the encrypted message, 
      use DECRYPT_MODE with the same secret key and pass the enrypted bytes to the cipher.
```
